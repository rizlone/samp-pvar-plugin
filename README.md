SA-MP PVar Plugin
================

This plugin is an extension to the per-player variable (PVar) system

- Much faster execution time
- PVars are automatically deleted when a player leaves the server (after OnPlayerDisconnect), meaning you don't have to manually reset variables for the next player who joins.
